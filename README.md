## Predicting Hospital Readmissions to Prevent Them
This project will look at demographic and clinical variables commonly collected on hospital admissions and determine their effectiveness in predicting hospital readmissions for diabetic patients. 

### Description
This project was a group project between me and two other classmates. We decided to try and predict the rate of readmission based on a dataset for diabetic patients. We were hoping to find a specific reason that may lead to a readmission, but was unable to pinpoint exactly what the cause might be. We looked at the diagnosis, sugar levels, socio-economic factors, and whether the patient was a diabetic before this particular hospitalization. 

### Main dataset
